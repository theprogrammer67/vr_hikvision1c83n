# delphi-markdown

Markdown Processor for Pascal (Delphi/FPC)

## Basic Information

This is a Pascal (Delphi) library that processes to markdown to HTML.
At present the following dialects of markdown are supported:

* The Daring Fireball dialect (see https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (translated from https://github.com/rjeschke/txtmark)
* The CommonMark Specification (see https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28) (not quite complete. Stil to do: link references)
* Github Flavored Markdown

All you need to use the library is any unicode version of Delphi, or FPC (lazarus). To run the 
tests, you also need FastMemoryManager, the Jedi Code Library and DUnitX.

## Using the Library

Create a TMarkdownProcessor (MarkdownProcessor.pas) of the dialect you want:

     var
       md : TMarkdownProcessor;
  
       md := TMarkdownProcessor.createDialect(mdDaringFireball)
  
Decide whether you want to allow active content (not supported for CommonMark)

       md.UnSafe := true;
  
Note: you should only set this to true if you *need* to - active content can be a signficant safety/security issue.  
 
Generate HTML from the Markdown content:

       html := md.process(markdown); 
  
Note that the HTML returned is an HTML fragment, not a full HTML page.

Internally, the library includes a comprehensive set of unit tests. For CommonMark,
the tests are those provided as part of the CommonMark spec.
